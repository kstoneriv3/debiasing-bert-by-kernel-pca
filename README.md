# Debiasing Bert By Kernel PCA

This repository contains the code for the project "Debiasing BERT by Kernel PCA" carried out as a part of NLP class at ETH Zurich.

## Directory Structure

The structure of the directory is as follows.

```
debiasing-bert-by-kernel-pca
├── __init__.py
├── notebooks
│   └── *.ipynb
├── out
│   ├── logs
│   └── plots
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── bert
    ├── experiments
    ├── kernel_pca
    └── seat
```

The directory `notebook` can be used to keep random jupyter notebook used during the development. The directory `src` contains the code of models and experiments.

## How to Run

```bash
# TODO
# 1. download dataset to the environment
command1
# 2. generate embeddings of debiasing sets and test data
command2
# 3. debias the test data
command3
# 4. evaluate the quality of debiasing
command4
```

### How to Run on Leonhard Cluster

```bash
# TODO
command5
```
